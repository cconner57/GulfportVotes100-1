# Getting Started:  
- **createdb gulfport_votes** for server to be able to be run.
- while in venv: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- As a side note, all computing I'm doing is on a macOS using zsh instead of bash

# Future Thoughts:
#### Implimentation of database:
- Username/password
- Adding calendar events
- Blog
- Documents for recreation of "____ Votes 100%" in other towns/cities

# Mockup:
